This application allows a user to search for a book in Google's book search API. If the book exists in the API then the the title, description, author, and image are displayed
in a list of modals on the screen. In order to save a book to be viewed at a later time, the user simply has to click the "Save" button on the bottom of each modal and 
head ove to the "Saved" option on the navigation bar and a list of the saved books will be displayed for the user in a similar fashion to the search page.

The application utilizes MERN Stack technologies (Mongo, Express, React, and Node.js) in order to dynamically display elements onto the screen, as well as to save data to a 
database using MongoDB and an Express server. This was a fun project to create; the only super difficult part was the Heroku deploy. Although I can't blame it necessarily on the
assignment itself; I am historically known to always have deployment troubles.
